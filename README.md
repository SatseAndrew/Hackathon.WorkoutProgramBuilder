# SATS Workout Program Builder and Logger (Proof of Concept)

## Vision

The vision of SATS is to make people healthier and happier™️.

## Potential Benefits

- Enables personal trainers to provide more targeted advice and foster client engagement.
- Enhances the social community within the SATS app by allowing users to interact through shared workout programs.
- Allows members to take ownership of their fitness progression.
- Provides immediate guidance and cautions for exercises, potentially reducing injuries.
